> A modular reflection system for emotional insight and structured thought

---

**remindly** is a unified framework for recording, analyzing, and expressing both emotion and structure.
It hosts two complementary agents:

- `feelbot/` – a poetic, emotionally resonant system for transforming vague feelings into clear language
- `ren/` – a structured thought partner and leadership AI grounded in global principles and real mechanisms

They serve different roles:
> *Feelbot is the room where you pause. Ren is the person who walks with you.*

This duality reflects the truth of human experience:
we need both **stillness** and **motion**, **emotion** and **structure** to move forward.

## 🌳 Core Modules

### 🚪 feelbot/
- Expressive transformation of vague emotions into bilingual, structured logs
- Interfaces: `tukkomi`, `turtle`, `message_from_the_moon`, `quiet_cosmos` etc.
- Output: Markdown-based emotional logs with tags, commentary, cosmic metaphors

### 🧑‍🏫 ren/
- Structured output generation based on global knowledge frameworks
- Sources: Drucker, Covey, Agile, First Principles, Radical Candor, etc.
- Output: Markdown-formatted insight documents following strict structural rules

### 🧭 architecture/
- Shared design principles, prompt schemas, and formatting rules
- This is where **intent is preserved** beyond code

## 🐚 Design Philosophy

remindly is not a chatbot.
It is a **tool for reflective living**, based on the belief that meaning arises from form.

Each module respects this philosophy:

- Emotion must be expressed gently, not analyzed away
- Structure must be shown clearly, not imposed harshly
- Every output must reflect both **truth and tenderness**
